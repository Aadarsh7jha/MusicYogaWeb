      <h2>Music Therapy (Yoga Nidra description)</h2>
      <p>It is well known that Yoga Nidra is a practice, which gives deep relaxation and recovery as after proper healthy sleep, however, it is not sleep.
        During this practice very deep inner work is going on, regardless of whether a person is a beginner in yoga or an experienced master.
        UNIQUENESS of Yoga Nidra by Sri Arun Dubey is that it is performed with the live Indian raag performed by a professional vocalist, a conductor of the oldest Indian musical tradition and a music therapist with extensive experience.
        </p>

       
 

        
        <h3>PROCESS:</h3>
        <p>A powerful energy-sound immersion awaits you through the beautiful deep voice of the Master accompanied by tanpura, sounding at healing frequencies.

          The Master will perform an Indian raag for you, specially selected for the assembled audience.
          (Raag — is a musical composition, structed according to the Ayurveda principles, which has power to deeply influence the human moods and connect the listener with the spiritual uplifting flow. Classical Indian raagas have been played from century to century only in temples and palaces, and now we have the opportunity to enjoy their extraordinary multifaceted sound and powerful impact.)
          </p>
          <h3>EFFECTS:</h3>
          <p>The level of personal practice and a person's condition will certainly determine the effect of Yoga Nidra.
            People who have any disbalance on the body-level will primarily have a recovery at the energy level. People experiencing stress and emotional/mental strain often fall asleep during Yoga Nidra, and after that they notice significant lightness and clarity of mind.
            Those who have the experience of real meditation will feel deep experiences. Many people see unusual images and "catch" important insights for themselves. 
            After practice, most people notice lightness in the body, a charge of life energy, calm and clear state of mind, and a feeling of joy.<br><br>

Due to the practice of Yoga Nidra, a wonderful recovering and quality rest occur in a short time. 
The extensive therapeutic experience of the Master shows that a SERIES of Yoga Nidra sessions is especially beneficial. Each session is unique, the music in these practices is never repeated and is tailored to the time of day and the audience. With each session, the person's recovery goes deeper and deeper, until finally, the person reaches that most desirable state of mind – thoughtless, a state of bliss and serene flight in the flow.
            </p>
            <h3>Spiritual performance / Stage performance            </h3>
            <p>Sri Arun Dubey is a hereditary temple vocalist and a Master of Classical Music. 
              His deep beautiful voice tone gives spiritual feeling and serenity immediately. There are many evidences, that during his performances people saw spiritual visions. And most of listeners can feel the atmosphere of temple by listening of his voice, even far abroad.
